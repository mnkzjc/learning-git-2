        <h1>The Lost Vikings</h1>
        <h3>by Dethklok</h3>
        <p>Riding, and riding, we search across the land <br>The snow, and wind, has frozen the hearts of man <br>But we ride <br>We ride</p>
        <p>Many days ago we left our home <br>With swords to ride into the night <br>Fighting side by side to destroy our foes <br>And leave them without life</p>
        <p>We stop, consider the land that we travelled <br>Our map's at home, direction unravelled <br>But we ride <br>We ride</p>
        <p>Many days ago we left our homes, <br>With swords to ride into the night <br>Fighting side by side to destroy our foes <br>And leave them without life</p>
        <p>So much time has passed since we left our land <br>That we've become concerned <br>And we'll never find the battle <br>That we should have fought and won</p>
        <p>But we won't stop searching</p>
        <p>Lost but still we ride <br>Search until we die</p>
        <p>We ride <br>We ride</p>
        <p>Hungry and tired the frigid plain yields little <br>We trudge on further, eating pride and snow that's brittle</p>
        <p>We ride <br>We ride</p>
